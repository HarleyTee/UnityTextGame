You are walking through a forest completely naked, it is peaceful, serenene almost dreamlike.
You walk past a tree and you spot a birds nest, a little blue wren pokes its head out and starts to chirp 
*Beep Beep Beep* you think that's a weird sound for a bird to make "BEEP BEEP BEEEEEEEEEEEP". 
You open your eyes grogily looking around wondering where the trees went 
and why the birds are making such annoying sounds. WYD?

Choices

1. Turn off the alarm and get up.
2. Turn the alarm off and try to get back to your forest.
3. Throw the alarm out the window.
