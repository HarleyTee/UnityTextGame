  storyText: "You turn the alarm off and close your eyes while still in the warm embrace
    of seratonin....Beep beeirp Chirp. The birds are making their normal noise again
    but they are a little off. They have the slightest of purple hue to their feathers
    and eyes giving you a sense of danger, your hackles raise and you start barking
    at a shadowy muscular figure running full speed toward you. Just as they are about
    to collide with you, you wake up with a start as your alarm starts blaring again\r\n\r\n1.Turn
    off the alarm and get out of bed, no more sleep will be had this morning"
