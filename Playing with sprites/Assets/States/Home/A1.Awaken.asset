  storyText: 'You are walking through a forest completely naked. It is peaceful, serenene
    and almost dreamlike. You walk past a tree and you spot a birds nest, a little
    blue wren pokes its head out and starts to chirp *Beep Beep Boop* you think that''s
    a weird sound for a bird to make "BEEP BEEP BEEEEEEEEEEEP".  You open your eyes
    grogily looking around wondering where the trees went and why the birds are making
    such annoying sounds. WYD?


    1. Turn off the alarm and get up.

    2. Turn the alarm off and get get back to your forest.

    3. Throw the alarm out the window.
