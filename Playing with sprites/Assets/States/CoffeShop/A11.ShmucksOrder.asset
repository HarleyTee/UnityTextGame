    are waiting for their coffees.\r\n\r\nAs you get to the front of the crowd you
    see a server in front of his terminal attending no one.\r\n\r\nYou walk over and
    ask for a latte with 1.\r\n\r\n\"Yes sir we will make that for you right way\"\r\n\r\nAs
    you go to sit back down and wait for your coffee you swear that that server had
    a glint of purple in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sit down and wait"
